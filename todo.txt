//7. Fix gradient for webkit and opera.
//3. Make Loader static with method main.
//4. Fix bug with unload.
//5. Organize ant task linter - involves writing of python script that scans for
//js files and runs gjslint.py.
//* week timed events should be used with position: relative, therefore we should
//into account that top position of rect should be shifted by height of previous
//event. Or (it's better) use  height: 70px; margin-bottom: -70px;
//6. Fix options image.
//2. Make mainpane build method dependent on view. Store buildImpl method in
//*view.js.
* about scrollbars, rely on condition document height > window height rather
than guessed calculations
* Think about very high screens, so week scrollable may show white space,
prevent this.
* choose one of decisions - reattach listener for scroll or simulate scroll with
combination of mouseup, mousewheel, keyboard
* When making Calendar API, enable to get size not only from window, but from
arbitrary container in which cal component may be placed.
* bug: IE7 wk-mask-cnt has non-zero size when empty.
* bug: make hours labels unselectable.
* Store in HTML_PARTS indexes of common subparts, like '</div>'.
And this common parts could be stored at rflect.cal.Component.HTML_PARTS by
theese indexes.
* it seems that scrollbar appears when we reducing height of viewport. It
disappears in a moment, but monitor sees that size with scroll.
Firefox and Opera

# Optimization
* Concatenate strings in HTML_PARTS by +, not by , as compiler would join them.
(see "<div id="weeknum-cont">" in mainpane.js)
* As gss works fine with string being concatenated with goog.getCssName
('lala' + goog.getCssName('lalal') -> lalalala), rename as much ids to classes
as possible.
* Expand signs should be moved to events layer. This will enable all dynamic
layout to be on event layer and all static layout on decoration layer.
* Consider not writing initializers of objects in prototype, do it in
constructor, instead?
8. Implement StringBuffer that only concatenates strings via join in IE7 or lower
(test it)
* Make HTML_PARTS as separate constants instead of Array.<string> for better
inlining.
* Make reusable goog.math.Size objects for better GC performance.
* If click on zippy doesn't require redraw, just change zippy's class instead
of redraw.
* remove block unused methods
* + add custom objects rather than Date to form month grid - native Date objects
 are slow, this could be seen in firefox 2, maybe it'll affect IE7 too
 override typedef goog.date.DateLike for this case
* + redesign init method to disable event patching

# Main
1. Update toppane.js with decorated buttons, classes they use should take their
names from css map.
* Cache built strings - for example, when we changed event in allday grid, we
could rebuild just allday grid and timed grid will be loaded from cache.
* Make buttons appear in order when hitting Tab (needs relayout)
* Store all API methods and classes in calapi.*, not in rflect.calapi, so there
won't be a need to export rflect.
* Consider to make allday grid expandable only vertically.
* for rtl version float: right for new event button should be considered
* -minor- make checked buttons do not respond to click at all
* bug - 22-28 apr 2012 in week mode doesn't show as now
* in month mode, block could be expanded when some rows are not shown. In week
mode, cols are shown until they have width < minimal width and they could be
expanded when cols have width < optimal width.
* make horizontal scroll by shift + wheel
* consider not allowing maximum block size in week mode to be greater than grid
container
* enable double-clicking on zippy for faster switch, this requires MainPane to
be Control
* decide whether alldaygrid would be expandable - make branch for it
* make id generator to allow possibility of multiple app instances
* now that position is present in Block, remove cumulative size calculation
in builder.
* bug: hollow expand signs are white, not transparent, this is visible with
mask.
* make mask more pixel-precise IE7, Webkit, Opera
* IE7 bug - click in month mode, numbers are shifted. Prevent selection
everywhere in grid
 * check localization after changing Date
 * Maybe remove scroll from allday grid scrollable
