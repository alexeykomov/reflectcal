1. In all-day events nesting algorothm, calculate slot rows as per month mode,
but draw rectangles cutted by weekgrid, i.e. every day is separated.

2. Whether we need to expand all-day grid or not defines if we would be able to fill

3. More wk expand signs.

--in Firefox, td height, if set through inline style, includes border.
In IE border isn't included.

Done--monthmode event rect, if placed relative, could be sized with margins. if positioned
 absolute, it cannot.

Done--in Opera, percent width get their decimal parts dropped

--in IE8 div with width:100% and filter:alpha get it's visual height reduced by 1px, and
in IE7 width is reduced instead. Solution: set height and width in pixels,
adding 1 to each dimension.

--Change px line-height and font-size to em

Done--Change height of wk row

--Colors
